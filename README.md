# ordermaticSwift
iOS/Swift version of the restaurant order management example app ("Ordermatic") whose model part can be transpiled by SequalsK.

Note that this is only a source code example of a project that uses the SequalsK transpiler. In order to use this app, you have to create an own Firebase project and integrate the resulting GoogleService-Info.plist file.
